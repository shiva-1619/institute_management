We developed an Educational Institutional Management in 
a simple windowed console application, the system can be run 
by entering the correct information of the student or faculty. 
The user can do two things here, he/she can manage both 
student and faculty section. Here if we need complete 
information about a student or about a faculty it displays the 
complete information just by entering his/her basic information. 
Here we developed a new feature for adding a new student or 
new faculty entry. We developed Educational Institutional 
Management using simple java code for easy understanding. 
The information of the student and faculty should be stored 
securely thus it is very confidential.
